With my experience, I would prefer heatmap chart, for instance, the figure in 

Heatmap_with_annot_True_cmap_coolwarm_linewidth_None.png

My point is that it is clear to understand the correlation between features. With annot=True, it also shows the numerical value and hence, provides an intuitive iinsight. 

Pairplots provide more information, in particular with kind='reg' as we can see if whether there is a linear relation between two features. 

Boxplot and Violinplot provide more statistical information such as standard deviation and hence, more useful but it was difficult to understand at the beginning. However, as my experience increases, I would choose these types of charts.

I learned about yellowbrick plots but I do not like it very much. Not many improvment with seaborn.
